# What to do in this iteration ( This should be removed later )

- Unit tests
- Elevator lights and buttons
- Floor buttons 
- Changes to sequence Diagram
  - Need to show scheduler creating threads
  - The full sequence of all function calls should be seen
- Feedback loops
  - Elevator needs to talk back to scheduler (That is this iterations)
- Print statements
  - Should say who is printing it not what thread is printing it
  - Like the scheduler got this message from the elevator (Which would be a thread)
