- We should be coming up with some states and how they interact by Monday.
  - That way we can have something to go off of once we're done midterms.
- This is my suggestion on how we should continue working in the github
  - Create a Branch with your name
  - Make changes to the files as needed
  - Create a pull request when you are complete
  - Allow people to write notes on the pull request before it is agreed that it is good
    - Unit tests are a requirement so that should be run with any code that is written before pushed to main
  - Push to main 

# Format
## StateName 
- Event
- Action
- Activity

Try to come up with as many as possible (at least two)
- We need the states of the elevator and scheduler (ex: moving, request)
- And what actions/events occur between the states (ex: button click)
